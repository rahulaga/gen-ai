Your client is authorized through an access token. The access token has a scope \nwhich defines which resources the token can access. For information about OAuth 2.0, see the \nOAuth specification at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-8 , or look at this blog post called \nOAuth 2.0 Simplified  at https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/ .\nHow does OAuth 2.0 work with VMware Cloud Services\nVMware Cloud services  covers several use cases for app authorization leveraging different \ngrant types, such as client credentials , authorization code , and public client  with \nauthorization code . Depending on your goals, you choose to create one of three types of \nOAuth apps that correspond to each grant type \u2013 respectively Server to server app, Web app, \nand Native/Mobile app.\nLet's say you are an Organization Owner  with access to VMware Cloud on AWS . You've \ndeveloped an app that helps you trade in stocks. You call the app Trading 1.0 . You want \nto run the app on virtual machines that are managed by a vCenter Server , but first, you must \nauthorize your app with the VMware Cloud on AWS  APIs.\n1You create an OAuth 2.0 app in the Cloud Services Console . Think of this as a way of \nregistering your Trading 1.0  app. You initiate the app's creation by clicking Create App  in \nthe Organization > OAuth Apps  menu and go through a series of steps. At the end of the \nprocess, we issue client credentials in the form of an app ID and app secret that are used to \nidentify your client with the APIs. You paste these credentials into your script.\n2Your app has been created in the Organization, but not yet given access to it. You grant \naccess by adding it to the Organization. This allows the app to access the services and \nresources in the Organization that you defined when creating the app. This step is required \nonly for apps that are of the Server to server app type, it is not applicable for Web and \nNative/Mobile apps.\n3When you run your Trading 1.0  client app, it requests an access token from the \nauthorization server. When authorized, the authorization server sends an access token to \nthe APIs and your client is granted access.\nWho can create and manage OAuth apps\nAs an Organization Owner  user, or an Organization Member  user with the Developer  role, you \ncreate and manage your OAuth apps.\nYou can also manage the OAuth apps created or added by other Organization Owners  in your \nOrganization.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 57", "doc_id": "c61ddc8e-c27a-41bc-999b-f46554de4d50", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "b5164d601cc42584459182e1e5a747b7a22213c6f0721dc5a8eb087ee7193c85", "extra_info": {"page_label": "57", "file_name": "Using-VMware-Cloud-Services.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2604, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "1bfced72-97af-47a3-a4dc-d1f5b2d2ce60"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "7969b95e-002a-443b-a06e-281128c7dc13": {"__data__": {"text": "Can I regenerate an app secret\nYes, as Organization Owner , you can regenerate the app secret of an OAuth app in your \nOrganization.

You are responsible for \nstoring these credentials in a safe place.\n8Click Continue .\nWhat to do next\nPaste the credentials into your script.\nWhat Is the difference between OAuth apps and API tokens\nYou use both OAuth apps and API tokens to interact with the VMware Cloud Services  APIs.\nAPI tokens are issued by users in an Organization and are associated with the user\u2019s account \nand the Organization from which they generated the API token. Once created by a user in an \nOrganization, OAuth apps act as entities in Server to server interactions and can be used in \nmultiple Organizations. Only the users who created the API tokens can manage them. The owner \nof the OAuth app is the Organization in which it was created, and can be managed by users who \nare Organization Owners  or Organization Members  with a Developer  role.\nYou can use both OAuth apps and API tokens to automate processes that interact with the \nVMware Cloud Services  APIs. The difference is that API tokens incorporate the user account in \nthe access token while OAuth apps perform authorization without a user account. When you \nmake a choice of using an API token or an OAuth app to make an API call, you must consider \nthe specific requirements of the API service involved in the interaction. Some APIs require a user \naccount to be the authenticated entity while others don\u2019t. For example, if you call an API to fetch \nBilling and Subscription information for your Organization in VMware Cloud Services , you can use \neither an OAuth app of the Server to server type or an API token to make calls to the API service \nas it does not require authentication through user credentials and accepts client credentials as \nwell. If an API is used by the users of an Organization to update their passwords, the API requires \na user to act as the authenticating entity.\nImportant    Before using OAuth apps of the Server to server type for automated calls to your \ncloud services, you must first consult the relevant API documentation.\nHow does auditing event logs in VMware Cloud Services \nwork\nAs an Organization Owner  user you audit users' activity in your VMware Cloud services \nOrganization by reviewing event logs. By using an associated instance of VMware Aria \nOperations for Logs , you can monitor events triggered by your Organization users as a result \nof activity with user logins, user management, API Tokens, OAuth Applications, and billing.\nVMware Aria Operations for Logs  is a VMware Cloud service and you need a paid or trial \nsubscription to use it.

For details, \nrefer to How to read my activity statement .\nQ: I don\u2019t see my usage data. Why?\nA: Usage management is not available for all VMware Cloud services . Some of the services that \ncurrently provide data about usage are VMware Cloud on AWS , VMware Aria Operations for \nNetworks , VMware Aria Operations , VMware Aria Operations for Logs , VMware Aria Automation , \nVMware Cloud Disaster Recovery , VMware Cloud Director , VMware Lab Platform . If your service \nis supported, depending on when your service usage occurred , it may take up to 48 hours to \nshow in this report. Note that some services provide data on a monthly basis.\nQ: How far back can I view usage data for?\nA: The default time period shown in the dashboard is 30 days. The minimum time period for \nwhich you can filter maximum daily usage data is 24 hours. The maximum time period is two \nyears. Note that at any given time the chart displays data for a maximum of one year period.\nQ: I don\u2019t see any hourly data. Why?\nA: Hourly data is only available for the last 30 days. Beyond that, only daily data is available.\nMy usage data does not reflect my bill. Why?\nA: Most services bill based on the sum of hourly overage that occurred during your billing period. \nIn this chart, you will see the actual usage for a given hour, and the maximum usage for a given \nday.\nQ: I don't see the Top Usage chart. Why?\nA: The Top Usage  chart only shows usage that occurred in the last 30 days for a service you \nhave a commitment for. If there is no service with usage that qualifies, the chart will not be shown \nat all. There are a few reasons you may not see your usage:\nnAll of your usage is for an On Demand service. On Demand usage does not show in the Top \nUsage chart.\nnYour usage is for a service that does not provide data about usage.\nnYour usage occurred over 30 days in the past.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 109", "doc_id": "32ade998-e46a-47b3-911c-88fb9e16b794", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "f99fc0a4a7a467c2ed3e2e75691cde58939405e14d355185dcf2fa52c77d6d2d", "extra_info": {"page_label": "109", "file_name": "Using-VMware-Cloud-Services.pdf"}, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2269, "_node_type": "1"}, "relationships": {"1": "d387f241-15ee-4c18-a4a2-13f2c37f7436"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "035bc894-843e-42d4-af2e-4902014cb833": {"__data__": {"text": "How do I view statements and invoices\nAs an Organization Owner  user, you can view and print the last 15 activity statements, on-\ndemand invoices, and yearly commitment invoices.\nView your statements and invoices by selecting Billing & Subscriptions  > Invoices and \nStatements  on the Cloud Services Console .\nYour Activity Statements\nThe Activity Statements page displays monthly summaries for all services consumed in a given \nbilling period.
