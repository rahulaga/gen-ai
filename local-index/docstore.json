These credentials can be something you Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 18\nknow such as your password, and something you have such as an application that generates a \none-time passcode. MFA helps protect access to data and applications by adding an extra layer \nof security.\nYou have probably already used MFA in some form or another. For example, if you logged into a \nwebsite that sent a code to your mobile device which you used to gain access to your account.\nNote    If your VMware Cloud Services  account is federated, MFA is managed by your enterprise \nsecurity team.\nTo secure your VMware Cloud Services  account with MFA, you download an authentication \napplication to your mobile device. This creates a virtual MFA device. The application generates \na six-digit authentication code that is compatible with the time-based, one-time password \nstandard. You use this code together with your VMware ID and password to log in to cloud \nservices.\nWhen you set up MFA for your account, you receive a set of 10 recovery codes. Save these \ncodes to a safe place. You'll need them to sign in if you don't have your MFA device near by, or if \nyou have lost it.\nHow do I?\nActivate my MFA device. 1Click your user name on the menu, and select My \nAccount > Security .\n2Click Activate MFA Device , and follow the instructions \nto set up your device.\n3MFA is turned on automatically.

As an \nOrganization Owner , you can view and edit user roles from the Cloud Services Console .\nHere's what you need to know about editing the roles of users.\nnUsers can hold a combination of roles - the roles assigned to them directly and the roles \ninherited from a group. For example, a direct role assignment for support user and some \ngroup-inherited roles such as developer and VMware Cloud on AWS  administrator.\nnWhen a user is assigned roles that conflict with one another, they receive the role that has \ngreater permissions. For example, if a user is assigned a read-only role and an administrator \nrole, they receive the administrator role.\nProcedure\n1On the Cloud Services Console  toolbar, click the VMware Cloud Services  icon and select \nIdentity & Access Management  > Active Users .\n2Click the double arrow icon (\n ) next to a user's name to view their roles and if they are part \nof groups.\nChanges you make to the user's role might override their group-assigned roles.\n3Select the check box next to a user and click Edit Roles .\n4Change the user's Organization roles and service roles as required.\n5Click Save .\nHow do I work with groups\nAssigning roles to groups is more efficient than assigning the same permissions to individual \nusers one at a time. As an Organization Owner  user, you create groups and determine the \nmembers that make up your groups and what roles they are assigned.\nYou can also edit groups after they are created or added. As your Organization expands and \nchanges, add or remove members from your groups.\nThere are two types of groups available in VMware Cloud services  \u2013 custom groups and \nenterprise groups. Custom groups can be shared with other Organizations. Enterprise groups \ncan be nested in custom groups.\nCustom GroupsUsing VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 37\nYou create custom groups by entering a name and a description, adding members, and then \nassigning roles for the Organization and its resources. For example, you can create a custom \ngroup and give it an Organization Member  role to your Organization and a support role, and \nread-only access to specific services in the Organization.

For example, you can create a custom \ngroup and give it an Organization Member  role to your Organization and a support role, and \nread-only access to specific services in the Organization. Custom groups can also include \nenterprise groups.\nFor custom groups, you can edit the name and description, add or remove members, and \nchange the role assignment of the group.\nShared Groups\nWhen you create a custom group, you can decide if you want to make it shared or not. As an \nOrganization Owner , you associate the shared group with other Organizations which allows \nthe members of the shared group to be assigned roles in the associated Organizations and \nget access to services without invitation from the Organization Owners .\nService roles assigned to shared groups are Organization-specific. The Organization Owners \nfrom the associated Organizations import the shared group and assign roles to the group \nwithin their own Organizations. To import a shared group, the Organization Owners  must \nknow the group name or ID.\nOnly the Organization Owner  of the source Organization \u2013 the Organization in which the \nshared group was created \u2013 can modify the members of the group or remove it. Removing \na shared group from an associated Organization does not delete it and it can be added back \nlater. See how to How do I manage shared groups .\nEnterprise Groups\nEnterprise groups are groups synced from your corporate domain. After you federate your \ncorporate domain with VMware Cloud services , your enterprise groups are available for you \nto use in your Organization. See how to How do I assign roles to enterprise groups .\nFor enterprise groups, you can only change the role assignment of the group. You cannot \nadd or remove members from enterprise groups in VMware Cloud services , but you can \nassign them roles for the Organization and its resources, and add them to custom groups.\nNested Groups\nAdding a group to another group is called nesting. Here's what you need to know about \nnested groups:\nnYou can nest an enterprise group in a custom group.\nnNested groups can hold a combination of roles; roles assigned directly to the enterprise \ngroup and the roles assigned through the custom group.\nnYou can edit the roles of a nested enterprise group or add additional roles, but you \ncannot remove the roles inherited from the custom group.\nnYou cannot nest a custom group in another custom group.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 38\nAs an Organization Owner , you can also edit groups after they are created or added. For custom \ngroups, you can edit the name and description, add or remove members, and change the role \nassignment of the group. For enterprise groups, you can only change the role assignment of the \ngroup.\nAs an Organization Owner  you create groups, manage the groups, and as your Organization \nexpands and changes add or remove members from your groups.\nNote    When you make changes to groups, it may take up to 30 minutes for the changes take \neffect in the Organization.\nHow do I create a new group\nAs an Organization Owner  user, you can create new groups in your Organization and assign the \ngroup Organization and service roles.

Enterprise federation with VMware Cloud services  is set up through a self-service \nworkflow and supports integration with SAML 2.0 based identity providers.\nBy adopting a federated identity access for VMware Cloud services  users and Organizations in \nyour enterprise, you activate the following:\nnAll users in your enterprise access VMware Cloud services  using their corporate account.\nnOrganization Owners  can control authentication to Organizations and services by assigning \nOrganization and service roles to the groups synced from your corporate directory.\nnYour security team can set up and enforce enterprise-level security and access policies for \nVMware Cloud services , including multi-factor authentication.\nAs an Organization Owner  of an unfederated domain, you initiate the self-service federation \nworkflow for your entire enterprise domain. After completing the setup, enterprise federation \nbecomes available to all users from your corporate domain and applies to all services across all \nOrganizations.\nAttention    Your enterprise must own the domains you want to federate for access with VMware \nCloud services  and you must verify the ownership during the first step of the self-service \nworkflow. You cannot federate domains that belong to a service provider.\nFor detailed instructions on setting up enterprise federation through the self-service federation \nworkflow, refer to the Setting Up Enterprise Federation with VMware Cloud Services Guide .\nWhat is the difference between federated and unfederated \nauthentication?\nIf your corporate domain is not federated, your access to VMware Cloud services  is \nauthenticated through your VMware ID account. If you are new to VMware Cloud services , visit \nmy.vmware.com  to create a VMware ID.\nIf your corporate domain is federated, your access to VMware Cloud services  is authenticated \nthrough your corporate account. A hosted Workspace ONE Access  tenant is used as an identity \nbroker to set up federation with your identity provider. The hosted tenant is configured for \nvalidation with your corporate identity provider and active directory. You manage user and \ngroup access to VMware Cloud services  by configuring the Workspace ONE Access  connector \nto sync users and groups from your corporate active directory. Only a subset of required user \nprofile attributes, such as username , firstname , lastname , and email address, is configured to \nbe synced. You can add more attributes later.\nNote    User passwords are never synced, nor cached.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 46\n.\nCan I undo the federation for my corporate domain?\nIf you decide to undo the federation setup or undo federation for any of the federated corporate \ndomains you initially configured, you must file a support ticket.\nWhat's involved in setting up enterprise federation for your \ncorporate domain\nSetting up enterprise federation for your corporate domain is a self-service process that involves \nmultiple steps, users, and roles.\nHere's who and what's involved in federating your corporate domain with VMware Cloud \nservices .\nOrganization Owner\nOrganization Owner  users of unfederated domains can kick off the federation setup from \nthe Cloud Services Console .

Any Organization Owner  can initiate the self-service federation \nprocess and assign one or more Enterprise Administrators  to complete the setup.\nOrganization Owners  who hold system administrator roles with their enterprise and have \nsufficient knowledge of the enterprise directory service and identity provider configuration, \ncan act as Enterprise Administrators  for the federation setup.\nEnterprise Administrator\nThe Enterprise Administrator  is a system administrator who belongs to the central security \nteam for your enterprise and manages the directory services and identity providers. As the \ndesignated person to set up enterprise federation for your corporate domain, the Enterprise \nAdministrator  completes the configuration and validation steps of the self-service setup \nprocess. Setting up enterprise federation might involve representatives of different security \nteams. The designated Enterprise Administrator  can invite other administrators to help with \nthe setup.\nThe Enterprise Federation Organization\nWhen an Organization Owner  initiates the self-service federation workflow for their \ncorporate domain by inviting one or more Enterprise Administrators , a special Federation \nOrganization becomes available for the set-up. Everyone involved in the self-service \nfederation process receives an email notification with a link to access the special Federation \nOrganization. The purpose of this Organization is to set up enterprise federation for the \ncorporate domain and to modify the initial setup.\nLinking corporate accounts to VMware IDs\nExisting users of VMware Cloud services  whose accounts are federated must link their \ncorporate accounts to their VMware ID accounts in order to access the services in their \nOrganization. New users onboarding to VMware Cloud services  after federation set up for Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 47\ntheir domains was activated don't need to create a VMware ID unless they need to view \nbilling information or file support tickets.\nVMware requires users of VMware Cloud services  who work with VMware for the purposes \nof billing and support, to have a VMware ID and link their corporate account with their \nVMware ID.\nVMware Workspace ONE Access tenant\nSetting up federated identity management requires the customer to configure and manage \na VMware Workspace ONE Access  tenant. The tenant is created as part of the self-service \nfederation process. The Workspace ONE Access  tenant acts as an identity broker (service \nprovider) to your identity provider and is not involved in the actual user authentication.\nThe self-service federation setup workflow\nThe self-service federation setup involves multiple steps that can be performed at various \ntimes by different Enterprise Administrators . The workflow resumes from the place it was \nleft last. Enterprise Administrators  involved in the setup must have VMware Cloud services \naccounts with a VMwareID. All steps in the federation setup are completed through the Set \nup Enterprise Federation  workflow in the special Federation Organization.\nWhy do I need to link my VMware ID\nIf you are an Organization Owner  or Support User with a federated account, you still need to \nhave a VMware ID linked to your corporate account so that you access billing information and \ncustomer support.\nWhy can't I see all my cloud services?\nYou must link your VMware ID account to your federated account so that you can access all \nthe services from your VMware ID account.

VMware Cloud Services \nsupports web application access where users of your app authorize access, and server-to-server \ninteractions where access tokens are issued directly to your app.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 56\nWhat is OAuth 2.0\nOAuth 2.0 is an authorization protocol that lets you grant your apps secure access to your \nresources. Your client is authorized through an access token. The access token has a scope \nwhich defines which resources the token can access. For information about OAuth 2.0, see the \nOAuth specification at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#page-8 , or look at this blog post called \nOAuth 2.0 Simplified  at https://aaronparecki.com/oauth-2-simplified/ .\nHow does OAuth 2.0 work with VMware Cloud Services\nVMware Cloud services  covers several use cases for app authorization leveraging different \ngrant types, such as client credentials , authorization code , and public client  with \nauthorization code . Depending on your goals, you choose to create one of three types of \nOAuth apps that correspond to each grant type \u2013 respectively Server to server app, Web app, \nand Native/Mobile app.\nLet's say you are an Organization Owner  with access to VMware Cloud on AWS . You've \ndeveloped an app that helps you trade in stocks. You call the app Trading 1.0 . You want \nto run the app on virtual machines that are managed by a vCenter Server , but first, you must \nauthorize your app with the VMware Cloud on AWS  APIs.\n1You create an OAuth 2.0 app in the Cloud Services Console . Think of this as a way of \nregistering your Trading 1.0  app. You initiate the app's creation by clicking Create App  in \nthe Organization > OAuth Apps  menu and go through a series of steps.

Think of this as a way of \nregistering your Trading 1.0  app. You initiate the app's creation by clicking Create App  in \nthe Organization > OAuth Apps  menu and go through a series of steps. At the end of the \nprocess, we issue client credentials in the form of an app ID and app secret that are used to \nidentify your client with the APIs. You paste these credentials into your script.\n2Your app has been created in the Organization, but not yet given access to it. You grant \naccess by adding it to the Organization. This allows the app to access the services and \nresources in the Organization that you defined when creating the app. This step is required \nonly for apps that are of the Server to server app type, it is not applicable for Web and \nNative/Mobile apps.\n3When you run your Trading 1.0  client app, it requests an access token from the \nauthorization server. When authorized, the authorization server sends an access token to \nthe APIs and your client is granted access.\nWho can create and manage OAuth apps\nAs an Organization Owner  user, or an Organization Member  user with the Developer  role, you \ncreate and manage your OAuth apps.\nYou can also manage the OAuth apps created or added by other Organization Owners  in your \nOrganization.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 57\nCan I regenerate an app secret\nYes, as Organization Owner , you can regenerate the app secret of an OAuth app in your \nOrganization. This is useful if the Organization Owner  who created the OAuth app is no longer \nwith your business enterprise and you want to continue running the app.\nCan I use an API Token authentication instead of an OAuth app\nYes, if an API mandates that a user is the authenticated entity in the authorization process, you \nmust use an API token instead.

Once created by a user in an \nOrganization, OAuth apps act as entities in Server to server interactions and can be used in \nmultiple Organizations. Only the users who created the API tokens can manage them. The owner \nof the OAuth app is the Organization in which it was created, and can be managed by users who \nare Organization Owners  or Organization Members  with a Developer  role.\nYou can use both OAuth apps and API tokens to automate processes that interact with the \nVMware Cloud Services  APIs. The difference is that API tokens incorporate the user account in \nthe access token while OAuth apps perform authorization without a user account. When you \nmake a choice of using an API token or an OAuth app to make an API call, you must consider \nthe specific requirements of the API service involved in the interaction. Some APIs require a user \naccount to be the authenticated entity while others don\u2019t.

This \nallows Organization Owners  to logically organize, map and track usage of their cloud services \nresources.\nWhen you think of resources in VMware Cloud Services , imagine pre-defined, measurable \nand logical segments of a specific service. By organizing the services resources in Projects , \nOrganization Owner  users can measure and track the usage of cloud services in their enterprise \nacross departments or Cost Centers.\nImportant    Only a few VMware Cloud services  have been enabled so far to use the Projects \nfeature in Cloud Services Console . To learn if a service you are using can utilize Projects  for \nresource grouping purposes, consult the documentation for that service or contact VMware \nSupport.Using VMware Cloud Services Console\nVMware, Inc. 72\nLet's say you have two Projects in your Organization \u2013 Project 1 and Project 2, and three services \n\u2013 Service A, Service B, and Service C.\nnServices A and B are enabled for Project 1.\nnServices B and C are enabled for Project 2.\nThe resource grouping of the enabled services allows resources of service B to be used in both \nProjects, while resources of service A and service C are used in one Project each.\nHow do I create a Project in Cloud Services Console\nTo set up and manage Projects , you must have an Organization Owner  or a Project \nAdministrator  role in the Organization.

Organization Member  users with \nadditional Billing Read-Only  role can view billing and subscription details for their Organization \nwithout the option to manage payment methods.\nEach Organization in VMware Cloud Services  is associated with a billing account.\nYou can use VMware Cloud services  on demand or by purchasing subscriptions for a term \nperiod of 1 or 3 years. The purchase order outlines the capacity, term start and end dates, \nand negotiated price of the commitments in the subscription. VMware Cloud Services  bills you \naccording to the terms laid out in the purchase order.\nYou receive one monthly invoice or Activity Statement for all costs incurred by the Organization's \nservices purchased through VMware.\nIf your Organization purchased services from multiple sellers, the Billing and Subscriptions  page \ndisplays information for all sellers. However, incurred costs and service charges information for \nthe services purchased through non-VMware sellers is not available through the Cloud Services \nConsole . Contact the seller to obtain this information.\nThis chapter includes the following topics:\nnGetting started with VMware Cloud Services billing and subscriptions\nnHow do I manage the payment methods for my Organization\nnHow do I work with VMware Cloud Services subscriptions and commitments\nnHow do I work with the Usage Management dashboard\nnHow do I view statements and invoices\nGetting started with VMware Cloud Services billing and \nsubscriptions\nWhen you purchase VMware Cloud Services  subscriptions for the first time, you receive an email \nwith a link that opens the VMware Cloud Services  onboarding workflow.\nVMware, Inc. 74\nAs a first time user and an Organization Owner  you provide address and default payment \nmethod when you set up the Organization.
